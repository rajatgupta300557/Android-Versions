# The Ultimate Guide to Privacy on Android
Take back control and decide exactly how information is used on your Android phone.

# 1. Uninstall unused apps
Time required: 2 minutes
Inconvenience level: 0/10
This first Android privacy step is a no-brainer and something everyone should do periodically: Look through all of the installed apps on your phone and remove anything you haven't used in the past month or two (so long as it isn't required by your IT department, of course!). Unused apps not only take a toll on your device's resources; they also have the potential to leave open doors to sensitive info that'd be better off closed.

# 2. Check on apps with access to your Google account
Time required: 2 minutes
Inconvenience level: 0/10
In addition to the phone-specific permissions, apps and services can request access to certain types of data within your Google account — things like your contacts, your Gmail messages, or even your Google Drive storage. Again, such access may be completely warranted and no cause for concern (and it'd be present only if you explicitly authorized it at some point), but once you're no longer actively using the associated app, you don't want to leave that pathway open.

# 3. Revisit your Android app permissions
Time required: 5 minutes
Inconvenience level: 0/10
Now that we've taken care of apps you're no longer using, let's think about the ones you are still actively engaging with — because even those may have permissions you once granted but no longer require.

# 4. Clamp down on your lock screen privacy
Time required: 1 minute
Inconvenience level: 1/10
By default, Android is typically set to show all of your notification content on your lock screen — and that means if someone else picks up your phone, they might see sensitive info without even having to put in a PIN, pattern, or passcode.

# 5. Opt out of Samsung's data-sharing systems and consider avoiding its apps
Time required: 5 minutes
Inconvenience level: 1/10
If you have a Samsung phone, listen up: The company is probably selling your data — not just using it internally and privately but outright selling it to third parties (and without being even remotely up-front about what's going on).

# 6. Turn off Google's ad personalization system
Time required: 2 minutes
Inconvenience level: 2/10
Google makes its money by showing ads around the internet — that's no secret. And it uses data about you to select ads that are, in theory, catered to your interests and more likely to be relevant to you. It never shares your data with advertisers, as mentioned at the top of this story, and all of the matching happens within Google and in a completely automated, machine-driven sense.

# 7. Start using a VPN
Time required: 5 minutes
Inconvenience level: 2/10
If you're using a company-connected phone, there's a decent chance your employer is already providing you with a corporate VPN (virtual private network). But if not, it's probably worth your while to set one up on your own.

# 8. Add extra encryption onto especially sensitive files
Time required: 3 minutes
Inconvenience level: 3/10
Give sensitive files on your phone an extra layer of encryption with Solid Explorer, which costs $3 after a two-week trial. The app lets you encrypt any file so it can be accessed only after your personal password or biometric authentication has been applied. That does mean you'll have to unlock the file every time you want to view or share it, which can be mildly annoying — but depending on what type of material you have on your device, it might be worth it for the added peace of mind.

# 9. Rethink your browser setup
Time required: 4 minutes
Inconvenience level: 4/10
Google's Chrome Android browser has all sorts of impressive features, but many of them inherently require some manner of privacy tradeoff in order to work. For instance, you can easily find any page you visited on any device with a super-fast search — but in order for that to happen, Google has to maintain a cross-device record of every site you visit.

# 10. Disable Android's location history feature
Time required: 3 minutes
Inconvenience level: 4/10
By default, Google keeps track of everywhere you go with your Android phone in tow. That allows the software to proactively give you traffic and commute alerts for places you commonly visit and also allows Google Assistant to make better suggestions based on your behavior — but it also, of course, gives Google quite the docket of data on your day-to-day whereabouts. (Again, the company doesn't actually share that info with anyone but does use it to determine what ads are shown to you in certain places.)

# 11. Ditch Gmail or Outlook for a more privacy-conscious email setup
Time required: 4 minutes
Inconvenience level: 6/10
If you're really serious about privacy, ProtonMail is the inbox you want to use. ProtonMail applies end-to-end encryption to every message you send, which makes sure no one other than its intended recipient can ever set eyes on it. It's a whole other level of protection from what you get with Gmail's encryption or the encryption provided by most third-party mail servers.

# 12. Encrypt your calls and messages
Time required: 4 minutes
Inconvenience level: 6/10
For full encryption on the calling and messaging front, Signal is the service you want. It adds end-to-end encryption only when you're communicating with other Signal users, however — which severely limits its usefulness — and it doesn't allow you to send and receive text messages from your computer, as most regular messaging apps now do.
Signal is free to use.

# 13. Disable your Google Web & App Activity
Time required: 2 minutes
Inconvenience level: 7/10
By default, Google keeps track of what you do on the web and within its apps, whenever you're signed into your account (as you generally are while using an Android device). It uses that info to serve up those targeted ads we keep coming back to, of course, but it also uses it to power personalization, results, and recommendations in places like Search, Maps, and Assistant. Without it enabled, in fact, some of Assistant's most useful commands won't work — on your phone or on any other Assistant-connected devices.

# 14. Disable your device backups
Time required: 2 minutes
Inconvenience level: 9/10
Last but not least, Android has the ability to back up your system data and then restore much of your system setup when the need arises. That's a supremely handy option to have — but it invariably requires some of your information to be stored within Google Drive in order to work.
